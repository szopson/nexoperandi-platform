## Brand Voice

### Personality
- Professional but not corporate
- Technical but accessible
- Confident, not arrogant
- Direct and efficient
- Outcome-focused

### Tone Variations

**Website/Marketing:** Authoritative, inspiring confidence
> "We build AI agents that actually work. No hype, no prototypes that break — production-ready automation that delivers ROI."

**Technical docs:** Clear, precise, helpful
> "The webhook expects a JSON payload with `email` and `company` fields. Optional: `source` for lead attribution."

**Client communication:** Warm, professional, solution-oriented
> "Based on our call, here's what I'm thinking: we start with the lead qualification flow, prove the value there, then expand to the full nurture sequence."

**Social media:** Punchy, valuable, engaging
> "Your team is spending 10 hours/week on data entry. Here's the uncomfortable math: that's €25K/year at average rates. A €3K automation pays for itself in 6 weeks."

### Writing Guidelines

**Do:**
- Lead with outcomes and benefits
- Use specific numbers when possible
- Write in active voice

**Don't:**
- Use jargon without explanation
- Make vague promises ("revolutionary AI")
- Sound like every other AI company
- Write walls of text

- Over-explain simple concepts

### Power Words
- Transform, automate, streamline

# n8n Workflow Activation Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

Your n8n webhook is returning:
```
404 - "The requested webhook 'visitor-intel' is not registered."
```

This means the workflow needs to be **activated** in n8n.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to n8n
```
https://piotr108-20108.wykr.es
```

### Step 2: Import Workflow

1. **Click "Workflows"** (left sidebar)
2. **Check if workflow exists:**
   - Look for: "Visitor Intelligence Agent - Google Sheets"
   - If NOT found ‚Üí Continue to Step 3
   - If found ‚Üí Skip to Step 4

3. **Import the workflow:**
   - Click **"+ Add workflow"** (top left or center)
   - Click **"..."** menu (top right)
   - Select **"Import from Clipboard"**
   - Open file: `visitor-intelligence-GOOGLE-SHEETS.json`
   - Copy **ALL contents** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into n8n
   - Click **"Import"**

### Step 3: Configure Webhook Path

The workflow webhook path needs to match your URL structure.

**Your URL:** `https://piotr108-20108.wykr.es/webhook-test/visitor-intel`

In the workflow:
1. Click on **"Webhook Trigger"** node (first node)
2. In the parameters panel:
   - **Path:** Should be `visitor-intel` (not `/webhook-test/visitor-intel`)
   - **Method:** POST
   - **Response Mode:** "Response Node"

**Important:** The base path `/webhook-test/` is configured in your n8n settings. The workflow only needs `visitor-intel`.

### Step 4: Configure Google Sheets (If Not Done)

1. **Click on "Save to Google Sheets" node**
2. **Credentials:**
   - Click dropdown
   - If no credentials exist:
     - Click "Create New"
     - Select "Google Sheets OAuth2 API"
     - Click "Connect my account"
     - Sign in to Google
     - Allow access
     - Click "Save"

3. **Document ID:**
   - Click dropdown
   - Select "NexOperandi - Visitor Intelligence"
   - (Or manually paste your spreadsheet ID)

4. **Sheet Name:**
   - Click dropdown
   - Select "All Visitors" (or "gid=0")

5. **Repeat for "Save to Hot Leads Sheet" node:**
   - Same spreadsheet
   - Sheet: "Hot Leads" (or "gid=1")

### Step 5: Configure Anthropic API

1. **Click on "AI Behavioral Insights" node**
2. **Credentials:**
   - Select your Anthropic credentials
   - If not set up:
     - Click "Create New"
     - Name: `anthropic-credentials`
     - API Key: Your Anthropic API key
     - Click "Save"

### Step 6: Save Workflow

1. **Click "Save" button** (top right)
2. Give it a name if prompted: "Visitor Intelligence Agent - Google Sheets"

### Step 7: ACTIVATE Workflow ‚≠ê

This is the most important step!

1. **Toggle "Active" switch** (top right corner)
2. Switch should turn **GREEN**
3. You should see: **"Workflow activated"** message

**Before activation:**
```
Inactive [     ] Active
```

**After activation:**
```
Inactive [‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†] Active  ‚Üê Should be GREEN
```

## üß™ Test After Activation

### Test 1: Direct Webhook Test

```bash
curl -X POST https://piotr108-20108.wykr.es/webhook-test/visitor-intel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://test.com","timeOnPage":45,"pagesViewed":3,"device":"desktop"}'

3. **Check terminal output:**
   ```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
cd apps/website
cat .env.local | grep N8N_VISITOR_INTEL_URL
```

**2. Check n8n workflow is active:**
```
http://piotr108.mikrus.xyz:40233
→ Workflows → Toggle should be green
```

**3. Check browser console:**
```
Open DevTools (F12) → Console
Look for errors
```

**4. Test API directly:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/visitor-intel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"http://test.com","timeOnPage":10}'
```

### Issue: Tracking not firing

**Check:** Wait at least 10 seconds on the page
**Check:** Make sure you're not on `/api` or admin routes
**Check:** Look for JavaScript errors in console

## Database Setup (PostgreSQL - Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Database

You have 3 hosting options:

**Option A: Supabase (Easiest)**
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create free account
3. Create new project
4. Free tier: 500MB database, 2GB bandwidth
5. Copy connection string

**Option B: Railway (Developer-Friendly)**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create account
3. "New Project" → "PostgreSQL"
4. $5 free credit, then ~$5-20/month
5. Copy connection details

**Option C: Self-Hosted (Advanced)**
1. Your existing server/VPS
2. Install PostgreSQL 15+
3. Configure access
4. Secure with SSL

### Step 2: Run Schema Script

```bash
# Connect to your database
psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-database

# Or use Supabase SQL Editor in dashboard

# Run the schema
\i integrations/agents/visitor-intelligence/DATABASE-SCHEMA.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ `visitor_intelligence` table (main data)
- ✅ `visitor_metrics_daily` table (aggregated stats)
- ✅ `hot_leads` table (high-intent visitors)
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ Views for common queries
- ✅ Triggers for auto-updates

### Step 3: Configure n8n Connection

1. Open n8n: `http://piotr108.mikrus.xyz:40233`
2. Go to **Credentials** → **New Credential**
3. Select **PostgreSQL**
4. Fill in details:
   ```
   Host: your-database-host
   Database: your-database-name
   User: your-database-user
   Password: your-database-password
   Port: 5432
   SSL: Enabled (for cloud databases)
   ```
5. Test connection → Save

### Step 4: Import Enhanced Workflow

Use the enhanced workflow with database storage:
- File: `visitor-intelligence-WITH-DATABASE.json`
- Adds 2 database nodes (Save to Database, Save Hot Leads)
- Automatically stores all visitor data

## Dashboard Setup

### Option 1: Build Custom Dashboard (Next.js)

Create a simple analytics page in your website:

**Location:** `apps/website/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Fetch data from your API
const getAnalytics = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/analytics/visitor-intelligence')
  return res.json()
}

// Display key metrics
export default async function AnalyticsPage() {
  const data = await getAnalytics()

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4">
      <MetricCard
        title="Total Visitors"
        value={data.totalVisitors}
        change="+12% vs last week"
      />
      <MetricCard
        title="Hot Leads"
        value={data.hotLeads}
        change="+23% vs last week"
      />
      <MetricCard
        title="Avg Lead Score"
        value={data.avgScore}
        change="+5% vs last week"
      />
      <MetricCard
        title="Conversion Rate"
        value={`${data.conversionRate}%`}
        change="+3% vs last week"
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Charts Library:** Use [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) or [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

---

### Option 2: Database Query Dashboard

**Simple SQL query for real-time monitoring:**

```sql
-- Live visitor feed (auto-refresh every 10 seconds)
SELECT
  id,
  session_id,
  url,
  lead_score,
  category,
  ai_insight,
  device,
  created_at
FROM visitor_intelligence
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Tools that auto-refresh:**

**C. Email Alert**
- Send email to sales team
- Include visitor details and recommended action

---

### Alert Type 2: Threshold Alerts

**When to alert:** Daily metrics exceed/drop below thresholds

**Examples:**
- 🔥 Hot leads > 10 today (opportunity!)
- ⚠️ Avg lead score < 25 (traffic quality issue)
- 📉 Visitors < 50% of normal (technical issue?)
- 🎉 Conversion rate > 5% (winning!)

**Implementation:**
- Create scheduled n8n workflow (runs daily)
- Query database for metrics
- Compare to thresholds
- Send notification if triggered

---

### Alert Type 3: Anomaly Detection

**When to alert:** Unusual patterns detected

**Examples:**
- Sudden spike in traffic (viral content? bot attack?)
- Drop in lead scores (ad campaign targeting issue?)
- Geographic anomalies (unexpected country traffic)

**Implementation:**
- Calculate rolling averages
- Detect statistical anomalies (>2 standard deviations)
- Alert on significant changes

---

ðŸ§µ How to evaluate AI automation opportunities (without the hype)

We analyzed 500+ implementations and found:

1/ Most businesses focus on the wrong metrics
Not "what's the coolest AI?" 
But "what saves us the most money?"

2/ The highest ROI agents aren't always obvious
Customer service automation: $3.50 return per $1 invested
Lead generation: 7x conversion improvement
Meeting schedulers: 11 hours saved per rep/week

3/ Implementation speed matters more than perfection
Quick wins in 30 days > perfect solution in 6 months

4/ Industry specifics change everything
E-commerce? Cart abandonment recovery (15-30% recovery rate)
SaaS? Onboarding automation (25-40% conversion boost)
Healthcare? Appointment no-show prevention (50% reduction)

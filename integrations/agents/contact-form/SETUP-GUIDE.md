## üéØ How AI Qualification Works

The AI analyzes:

   - Urgency signals ("urgent", "ASAP", "deadline")
   - Problem complexity
   - Technical depth

2. **Lead Quality Indicators:**
   - Has website = more serious
   - Specific problem description = higher quality
   - Mentions budget = ready to buy
   - Timeline mentioned = high intent

3. **Scoring System:**
   - **0-29:** Low priority (tire-kickers, generic inquiries)
   - **30-69:** Medium priority (qualified prospects)
   - **70-100:** High priority (hot leads, ready to buy)

## üìä Lead Score Examples

### High Score (70-95):
> "Hi, I'm CTO at a Series B startup. We need to automate our customer onboarding process. We have a $75k budget allocated and need to implement this by Q1. Can we schedule a call this week?"

**Why High:**
- Clear title/authority (CTO)
- Specific problem (onboarding automation)
- Budget mentioned ($75k)
- Timeline (Q1)
- Ready to talk (schedule call this week)

### Medium Score (40-65):
> "I'm interested in learning more about your AI automation services. We're a small business looking to improve efficiency. What are your rates?"

**Why Medium:**
- General interest (not specific)
- Small business (smaller budget likely)
- Asking about rates (price shopping)
- No timeline or urgency

### Low Score (10-35):
> "Hi, can you help me? I need AI stuff."

**Why Low:**
